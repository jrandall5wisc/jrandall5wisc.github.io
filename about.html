	<p> Welcome viewers! My name is Jamie Randall and I am a Sophomore here at UW-Madison majoring in Journalism with certificates in Business and Digital Studies. I am involved in many organizations across campus and one of my favorites is being a staff writer for Moda Magazine. I have written a variety of pieces for this publication and am very excited to show them for you all to read!
	To learn more about Moda Magazine go to <a href="http://modamadison.com/"> modamadison.com</a> where you will see more amazing writing done by UW students!</p> 
<p> One of my hobbies is photography and I have been able to take some amazing photos of my friends and surroundings here at UW-Madison. Enjoy!
